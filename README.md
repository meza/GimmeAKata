GimmeAKata
==========

This project should answer the question: Which Programming Kata should I write now, in which programming language.

The list of languages is just a random compilation, it should be enhanced to the most popular N language with a decent unit testing framework.
The list of Katas is a quick one, but it should only contain excercises which could be completed under 30 minutes. (After learning the logic)

Future features:
 * User support with preferences
 * JSON api for the non-browser players
